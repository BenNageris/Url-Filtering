# Url-Filtering

Real Time Url Filtering


This Project has been done by Ben Nageris and Yoav Magid as part of our final project in College.

In order to run this code efficiently you would need to replace:

<ENTER_YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS> = 'Url_Filtering_Server' Domain Name

<PATH_TO_FORBIDDEN_PAGE> = Redirection page url

<Word2Vec_SERVER_DOMAIN_NAME> = 'word2vec' server Domain Name

<ENTER_DB_HOST> = DB HOSTNAME

<ENTER_DB_USERNAME> = DB USERNAME

<ENTER_DB_PASSWORD> = DB PASSWORD

<ENTER_DB_NAME> = DB NAME

<ENTER_SECRET_JWY_SYMMETRIC_KEY> = SECRET SYMMETRIC KEY - used for json web token (JWT)
